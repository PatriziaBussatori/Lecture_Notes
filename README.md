# Lecture_Notes_and_Presentations
Here there are all lecture notes and Power Point presentations that I wrote for different courses of Astrophysics and Cosmology. As these are not official professors approved notes, I do not guarantee the correctness of the contents. Indeed, any error reporting is welcome!
Enjoy the reading!
